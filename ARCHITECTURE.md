# AI Local Learning Framework - Architecture Document

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a generic AI framework that enables users to train machine learning models locally using their own system events and data. The framework provides a complete solution for collecting data, training models, and generating predictions entirely on the user's device, with no external dependencies or data transmission.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Self-Contained Operation**

### 2. **Generic and Extensible**
- **Configurable data sources**: Users define what data to collect
- **Flexible model types**: Support for various ML algorithms
- **Customizable features**: Adaptable to different use cases
- **Plugin architecture**: Easy to extend with new capabilities

### 3. **Privacy-First Design**
- **Local-only processing**: All operations happen on-device
- **User-controlled data**: Clear consent and configuration options
- **Transparent operations**: Users can inspect all data and models
