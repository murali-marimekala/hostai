#### 4. Recommendation Engine

**Purpose**: Generate actionable insights and suggestions based on learned patterns.

**Components**:
- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluates current tasks and projects
- **Schedule Optimizer**: Suggests when to work on different tasks
- **Context Generator**: Provides reasoning for recommendations
- **User Feedback Loop**: Learns from user acceptance/rejection of suggestions

#### 5. User Interface Layer

**Purpose**: Present recommendations in an intuitive, non-intrusive way.

**Components**:
- **Login Dashboard**: Shows prioritized tasks upon login
- **Notification System**: Gentle reminders during work sessions
- **Settings Panel**: Allows users to configure preferences and privacy settings
- **Feedback Interface**: Quick ways to accept/reject suggestions

## Data Flow

```
Raw Activity Data → Data Processing → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Recommendations → User Interface
```

### Detailed Data Flow:

1. **Collection Phase**:
   - System hooks capture file system events
   - Application monitors track usage patterns
   - Time-based sampling records activity levels

2. **Processing Phase**:
   - Data is aggregated and cleaned
   - Features are extracted (time patterns, file types, app sequences)
   - Privacy filters remove sensitive information

3. **Learning Phase**:
   - Models are trained on historical data
   - Patterns are identified and weighted
   - Models are updated incrementally

4. **Recommendation Phase**:
   - Current context is analyzed
   - Models predict optimal actions
   - Recommendations are generated and ranked

5. **Presentation Phase**:
   - Recommendations are displayed at login
   - Real-time suggestions are provided
   - User feedback is collected for model improvement

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

#### Backend (Python-based)
