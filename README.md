# AI Personal Productivity Assistant

An intelligent, offline AI application that learns from your laptop activity to provide personalized work recommendations and productivity insights.

## Features

- **Offline Learning**: Trains AI models locally on your machine
- **Activity Monitoring**: Tracks file usage, application patterns, and work habits
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests optimal tasks and work schedules
- **Privacy-First**: All data stays on your device
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-productivity-assistant.git
cd ai-productivity-assistant
```

2. Run the setup script:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

3. Edit your privacy configuration:
```bash
nano ~/.ai_productivity_assistant/config/user_config.yaml
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

## Architecture

This application follows a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Data Collection**: Monitors system activity and file usage
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and transforms raw activity data
- **Machine Learning**: Trains models on user patterns
- **Recommendation Engine**: Generates personalized suggestions
- **User Interface**: Provides intuitive access to insights

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed technical documentation.

## üîí Security & Privacy

This application is designed with privacy as the highest priority:

- **Local-only processing**: No data ever leaves your device
- **Configurable privacy controls**: Customize what data is collected
- **Automatic data cleanup**: Old data is regularly purged
- **Transparent operation**: Clear visibility into all data collection

For detailed security information, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## üöÄ Making Your Project Available on GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it `ai-productivity-assistant`
4. **Important**: Initialize with a README (we'll replace it)
5. **Do NOT** add .gitignore (we have a custom one)

### Step 2: Push Your Code Safely

```bash
# Add all safe files to git
git add .

# Verify what will be committed (should NOT include sensitive files)
git status

# If sensitive files appear, check .gitignore and remove them
git reset HEAD sensitive_file.db

# Commit the safe files
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Personal Productivity Assistant"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ai-productivity-assistant.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Security

Run these checks to ensure no sensitive data was committed:

```bash
# Check for sensitive files on GitHub
git ls-files | grep -E "\.(db|sqlite|pkl|h5|log)$"

# Check for sensitive patterns
git grep -i "password\|secret\|key\|token" -- "*.py" "*.yaml" "*.md"
```

### Step 4: Set Up Repository Settings

1. **Enable branch protection**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches
   - Add rule for `main` branch
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass

2. **Add repository topics**:
   - productivity
   - ai
   - machine-learning
   - privacy
   - python

3. **Add repository description**:
   ```
   AI-powered personal productivity assistant that learns from your activity patterns to provide intelligent work recommendations. Privacy-first, offline operation.
   ```
