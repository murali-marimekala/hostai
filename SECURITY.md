# üîí Security Guide for AI Personal Productivity Assistant

## Overview

This guide outlines the security measures implemented in the AI Personal Productivity Assistant to protect user privacy and prevent sensitive data from being exposed. The application is designed with a "privacy-first" approach, ensuring all data processing happens locally and no information is transmitted to external servers.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Principles

### 1. Local-Only Processing
- **No external data transmission**: All AI processing happens on the user's device
- **No cloud dependencies**: Models are trained and run locally
- **No telemetry by default**: Usage statistics are not collected unless explicitly enabled

### 2. Data Minimization
- **Minimal data collection**: Only necessary activity data is monitored
- **Configurable privacy filters**: Users can exclude sensitive files and applications
- **Data retention limits**: Old data is automatically cleaned up

### 3. User Control
- **Opt-in features**: All monitoring features are configurable
- **Transparent data usage**: Clear visibility into what data is collected
- **Easy data deletion**: Users can reset or delete all collected data

## üìÅ Protected File Categories

### Sensitive Data Files (Never Committed)
The `.gitignore` file excludes the following sensitive file types:

#### User Configuration
- `config/user_config.yaml` - Personal privacy settings
- `config/local_config.yaml` - Local environment configuration
- `.env` - Environment variables and API keys

#### Data Files
- `*.db`, `*.sqlite*` - Local databases with activity data
- `data/`, `user_data/` - Collected activity data
- `activity_logs/` - Detailed activity logs

#### Model Files
- `models/trained/` - Trained AI models (may contain patterns)
- `*.pkl`, `*.h5`, `*.pb` - Model checkpoint files

#### Log Files
- `logs/`, `*.log` - Application logs with user activity

### Safe Files (Can Be Committed)
- `config/example_config.yaml` - Template configuration
- `config/default_config.yaml` - Default settings
- Source code files
- Documentation

## üîß Setup Security

### 1. Repository Initialization
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your settings (keep it private!)
nano .env
```

### 2. User Configuration
```bash
# Run setup script
./setup.sh

# Edit user configuration
nano ~/.ai_productivity_assistant/config/user_config.yaml
```

### 3. Privacy Settings Configuration
Customize these settings in your `user_config.yaml`:

```yaml
PRIVACY:
  EXCLUDE_PATHS:
    - "~/Documents/Financial/"
    - "~/Documents/Medical/"
    - "~/Desktop/Sensitive/"
  EXCLUDE_APPS:
    - "Banking App"
    - "Password Manager"
  SENSITIVE_KEYWORDS:
    - "password"
    - "ssn"
    - "bank account"
```

## üö® Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit sensitive files**: Always check `git status` before committing
2. **Use environment variables**: Store sensitive config in `.env` (gitignored)
3. **Review .gitignore**: Ensure all sensitive patterns are excluded
4. **Test with clean repository**: Verify no sensitive data is committed

### For Users
1. **Review configuration**: Check privacy settings before first use
2. **Monitor data collection**: Regularly review what data is being collected
3. **Keep software updated**: Update to latest version for security patches
4. **Backup safely**: Export configurations without sensitive data

### Repository Management
1. **Use separate branches**: Keep sensitive config in separate branches
2. **Regular audits**: Periodically check repository for sensitive data
3. **Access control**: Limit repository access to trusted contributors
4. **Code reviews**: Review all commits for potential data leaks

## üîç Security Checks

### Pre-Commit Checks
Before committing code, run these checks:

```bash
# Check for sensitive files
git status

# Verify .gitignore is working
git check-ignore -v config/user_config.yaml

# Search for sensitive patterns
git grep -i "password\|secret\|key\|token" -- "*.py" "*.yaml" "*.md"
```

### Automated Security Scanning
```bash
# Check for secrets in code
pip install detect-secrets
detect-secrets scan

# Lint for security issues
pip install bandit
bandit -r src/
```

## üö´ What NOT to Do

### ‚ùå Never Commit These
- Personal configuration files
- Database files with user data
- Log files with activity details
- API keys or credentials
- Trained models with user patterns

### ‚ùå Avoid These Patterns
- Hardcoding sensitive information in source code
- Logging sensitive data to files
- Transmitting data to external services
- Storing unencrypted sensitive data

## üîê Encryption and Data Protection

### Database Encryption
The application supports optional database encryption:
```yaml
ADVANCED:
  ENCRYPT_DATABASE: true
  ENCRYPTION_KEY: "your-256-bit-encryption-key"
```

### File-Level Security
- Configuration files are stored in user home directory
- Database files are SQLite with optional encryption
- Log files are rotated and cleaned automatically

## üìä Privacy Impact Assessment

### Data Collection Scope
- **File access patterns**: Timestamps and file types only
- **Application usage**: Application names and usage duration
- **System activity**: General activity levels (not content)

### Data Retention
- **Activity data**: Configurable retention period (default: 90 days)
- **Models**: Automatically retrained, old models discarded
- **Logs**: Rotated and cleaned (default: 10MB max)

### Data Access
- **Local only**: No external access to user data
- **User controlled**: Users can view, export, or delete all data
- **No sharing**: Data is never shared with third parties

## üö® Incident Response

### If Sensitive Data is Accidentally Committed
1. **Immediate action**: Remove the commit from history
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Remove last commit
   git push --force-with-lease  # Force push to remove from remote
   ```

2. **Change credentials**: If API keys were exposed, regenerate them

3. **Notify affected parties**: If user data was exposed

4. **Review process**: Identify how the breach occurred and prevent recurrence

### Prevention Measures
- Use `.gitignore` templates
- Enable Git hooks for pre-commit checks
- Regular security audits
- Two-person review for sensitive changes

## üìû Support and Security Issues

### Reporting Security Issues
- **Do not create public issues** for security vulnerabilities
- Contact maintainers directly through secure channels
- Allow time for fixes before public disclosure

### Getting Help
- Check this SECURITY.md document
- Review the setup script for configuration help
- Use the application's built-in privacy controls

## üîÑ Updates and Maintenance

### Security Updates
- Regular dependency updates
- Security patch releases
- Vulnerability assessments

### Deprecation Notices
- Advance notice for breaking privacy changes
- Migration guides for configuration updates
- Clear communication of security improvements
