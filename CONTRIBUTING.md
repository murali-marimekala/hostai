## ü§ù Code of Conduct

This project follows a code of conduct to ensure a welcoming environment for all contributors. By participating, you agree to:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Maintain user privacy and security
- Follow the security guidelines outlined in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with privacy and security best practices

### Quick Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-productivity-assistant.git
   cd ai-productivity-assistant
   ```
3. **Set up development environment**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Environment Configuration

1. **Copy environment template**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit configuration** (optional for development):
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available
   ```

### IDE Setup

We recommend using VS Code with the following extensions:
- Python
- Pylance
- GitLens
- Prettier (for documentation)

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Critical Security Rules

1. **Never commit sensitive data**:
   - Database files (`.db`, `.sqlite`)
   - Log files (`.log`)
   - User configuration files
   - API keys or credentials
   - Trained models with user data

2. **Always check before committing**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff --cached
   ```

3. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration:
   ```python
   # Good
   import os
   api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')

   # Bad - hardcoded
   api_key = "sk-your-secret-key"
   ```

4. **Follow the principle of least privilege**:
   - Request minimal permissions
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing

### Security Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, ensure:

- [ ] No sensitive data is committed
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are from trusted sources
- [ ] Code follows secure coding practices

## üìù Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good
feat: add privacy filter for sensitive file types
fix: resolve memory leak in activity monitor
docs: update security guidelines

# Bad
update
fix bug
changes
```

### Branch Naming

```bash
feature/add-privacy-controls
bugfix/fix-memory-leak
docs/update-security-guide
hotfix/critical-security-patch
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_privacy.py

# Run tests in verbose mode
pytest -v
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Include integration tests for new features
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Test privacy controls thoroughly

### Test Coverage

Maintain test coverage above 80% for new code. Run coverage reports:

```bash
pytest --cov=src/ --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## üì§ Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

2. **Run all checks**:
   ```bash
   # Security checks
   git status  # Ensure no sensitive files

   # Code quality
   black --check src/
   isort --check-only src/
   flake8 src/

   # Tests
   pytest --cov=src/
   ```

3. **Create a pull request**:
   - Use a descriptive title
   - Provide detailed description
   - Reference related issues
   - Add screenshots for UI changes

4. **Address review feedback**:
